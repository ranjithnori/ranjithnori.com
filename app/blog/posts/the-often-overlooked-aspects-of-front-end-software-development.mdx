In the realm of front-end software development, certain aspects often fly under the radar. While the rush to roll out new features can dominate the conversation, it's crucial to recognize that several underrated elements play a significant role in creating a sustainable and effective codebase. Here are some of those key components:

1. **Setting Up Linting and Formatting**: Implementing tools like ESLint and Prettier ensures code consistency and helps catch errors early, making the development process smoother.

2. **Updating npm Packages**: Regularly updating dependencies is vital for maintaining security and performance. Staying current with package versions can prevent vulnerabilities and enhance functionality.

3. **Thorough Code Reviews**: Engaging in comprehensive code reviews fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing while improving overall code quality by catching potential issues before they reach production.

4. **Adhering to Best Practices**: Following industry best practices keeps the codebase maintainable and scalable, ensuring that new developers can easily understand and contribute to the project.

5. **Cultivating a Strong Engineering Culture**: Building a positive engineering culture enhances team collaboration, encourages innovation, and boosts morale, leading to higher productivity and job satisfaction.

6. **Implementing a Robust Test Suite**: A solid suite of tests—covering unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios—provides confidence that new features won't disrupt existing functionality.

7. **Utilizing Monitoring Tools**: Tools like Sentry and Google Analytics are essential for tracking application performance and user behavior, allowing teams to make data-driven decisions for improvements.

8. **Managing Technical Debt**: Regularly addressing technical debt through refactoring and code improvements is crucial for preventing the codebase from becoming unwieldy over time.

9. **Mentoring Junior Engineers**: Guiding junior engineers on how to write good code fosters knowledge transfer and strengthens the team's overall capability.

10. **Staying Updated with JavaScript Ecosystem**: Keeping abreast of the ever-evolving JavaScript landscape ensures that developers are aware of new tools, frameworks, and best practices.

11. **Documenting Complex Code**: Proper documentation of intricate code sections enhances maintainability and helps future developers understand the rationale behind design choices.

The list goes on...

While it may seem that quickly developing more features is the primary way to deliver business value, these underrated aspects are equally important for fostering a healthier codebase that your team will appreciate in the long run.

So, the next time your managers or higher-ups question why you want to invest time in refactoring code when there are no visible changes for customers, take the opportunity to explain how these efforts contribute to long-term business value.
